#                                                    Title

This project report is about HerAlerts:  a unique women safety and emergency app programmed and designed by Vipula Sail and Jaya Preethi Chamarthi.


It is made by Vipula Sail for submission to Lakshya Sivaramakrishnan, our mentor on Sunday 4th October,2020.
# ABSTRACT

Women safety is an issue which is much talked about yet the implementation of the laws taking place on the ground is bare minimum.

   ##   It is crystal clear: Women still feel insecure.

Be it in workplaces, institutes or public places, women need to keep vigilance at all times. In India, there are only 125 police officers for every 100,000 women and this is one of the lowest police to population ratios in the world.
 
That‚Äôs why: an app with safety features is a must for all women whether she is in a rural or urban area.

INTRODUCTION

This project wouldn‚Äôt have been even conceived if it was not for Prayogshaala: A Bootcamp For Engineering College Girls which was so beautifully curated by Lakshya who has now become our mentor.

Initially started out as an assignment to be submitted for Prayogshaala, HerAlerts has now become a passion for its makers:
Vipula Sail, Design Thinker and Product Architect and Jaya Preethi Chamarthi, Ace  Programmer (SIH finalist 2019). 

We can‚Äôt thank Lakshya enough to have given this opportunity to pair program this app. Being girls in technology, we feel this could be our small contribution to the womankind. We try to achieve nothing less than complete relief to its users as well her trusted ones.
However, a lot of work still rests to be in done in its public visibility
and marketing.

# FLUTTER
Flutter SDK is Google‚Äôs UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web and desktop from a single codebase.
## That‚Äôs why: FLUTTER.
Not only we found it convenient and more hands-on but also its quick installation and integration with Android Studio gave us more time to think and customize our features than worrying about compilation and debugging. Dart is the language which we used.
# FLUTTER WITH FIREBASE:
### A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN
 Firebase is a service made by Google which just acts a backend to our applications. 
 It includes real time hosting and cloud hosting services like providing a database and authentication services so that we can focus entirely on building our app with Flutter.
On A Lighter Noteüòä
# BASIC APP STRUCTURE        
Our basic app structure consists of a home page with an authentication scaffold which calls the respective functions for Appbar (Bottom Navigation Bar In Our Case) and Settings regarding the Trust List, Committed Button and Resources.


### Now for some theory essentials of flutter:   

WRAP ,SCAFFOLD CLASS AND  BUILD WIDGETS
WRAP: A widget that displays its children in multiple horizontal or vertical runs.A Wrap lays  out each child and attempts toplace the adjacent to the previous childin the main axis,given by direction,leaving spacingspace in between.

SCAFFOLD: Scaffold is a class in flutter which provides many widgets or we can say APIs like Drawer,SnackBar,BottomNavigationBar,
FloatingActionButton,appBar etc.Scaffold will provide a framework to implement the basic material design layout of the application.

BUILD METHOD:
Describes the part of the user interface represented by this widget.The framework calls this method when this widget is inserted into the tree in agiven BuildContext and the dependencies of the widget change(e.g.,an InheritedWidget referenced by this widget changes).

# TRUST LIST

A key feature of our app, the trust list is what our app gets working‚Ä¶seamlessly. A feature which lets the user add numbers of her most trusted ones on go without referring to unnecessary contacts .The ‚ÄúTrust List‚Äù are  basically the contacts which receive notifications when the user is in emergency. The user can also send customized messages using HER TRUSTED ‚ÄúTRUST LIST.‚Äù

                                              

# COMMITED
 
Commited is the name we have given to the person who shall receive a call when the user pushes the red coloured button.
He/she can track her location by the Google maps integrated with the firebase API.
Above is the code for the url which launches the command for the call.








# 	RESOURCES

As an add on feature we have introduced self defence videos in our app which the user can view in her leisure time to hone her skills and get ready for any unforeseen situation.
















# CONCLUSION

1.The software development procedure used was the agile and scrum framework. 

2.We worked on it from 28/09/2020 from 04/10/2020.

3.The static app is submitted along with it.
